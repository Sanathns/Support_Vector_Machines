# Support_Vector_Machines
This repository contains my assignment on Support Vector Machines (SVM) completed during my data science course.It explores the fundamentals of SVM and its application in classification tasks. The assignment includes code implementations, datasets, and a detailed explanation of the SVM model's workings. A valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about SVMs and their practical use in machine learning.
